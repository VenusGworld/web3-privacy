# **What is this for?**

Historically privacy in web3 & crypto is centred around financial use cases. But what if agency over privacy could lead to Facebook's business model disruption, drastically decrease government surveillance apparatus or force Nike to reduce consumerist pollution? That's what privacy & decentralisation could accomplish together. 

The tool is to help you brainstorm & select practical ideas for privacy use-cases. Moreover, it will allow builders to expand their vision of where privacy matters & what role your data plays in redesigning a status quo between centralised & decentralised approaches. 

The "**What if... they won't have my data**" matrix helps you categorize ideas according to:

- _Datasets_: what private data is involved in the cases 
- _Threat actors_: what kind of threat actors (governments, corporates, hackers) are involved in data abuse
- _Available data abuses_: how these actors use your data
- _Unavailable data impact_: how data usage or approach changes when there's no data available
- _Privacy benefits_: how systems, relations, economies change after getting back control of your data

# **Step-by-step guide**

**Step 1**
Download matrix (use JPG, PPTX or print version). You can also draw the graph on a flipchart.

**Step 2**
Brainstorm ideas solo or with your team. Fill up matrix' blocks with your ideas. 

**Step 3**
Take 3 voting-dots for each person (or use a marker), and vote 3 favorite ideas. After the voting session, select the 3 ideas which received the most votes.

**Step 4**
Step back and analyze the privacy benefits. In an ideal scenario, your “unavailable data impact” and “benefits” fields should highlight the most feasible ideas for now – and the most impactful for the future.

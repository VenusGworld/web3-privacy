# web3privacy now
**Web3privacy now** is a research project aimed at discovering, highlighting, and analyzing privacy-preservation services and startups within the Web3 space.

![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/logo2.png?raw=true)

⚠️ **Note!** Highlighted projects facilitate a different approach to privacy. Their solutions maturity varies from conceptualisation to mainnet. So use them cautiously, especially when projects don't have a third-party security audit. That's why **Web3Privacy Now** is ongoing research: aggregation (_we are here now_) - audit - scoring.

Feel free to update the list!

# web3privacy now - 400+ privacy projects empowering Web3 
*Web3privacy now* is a research project aimed at building a culture of privacy industry in web3: the most extensive database of privacy-enhancing solutions, the framework for PEDApps ideation, use-cases database & many more. Feel free to collaborate. [donate](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/README.md#donate)

⚠️ **Note!** Highlighted Privacy Enhanced Decentralised Applications (PEDApps) facilitate a different approach to privacy. Their solutions' maturity varies from conceptualisation to mainnet. So use them cautiously, especially when projects don't have a third-party security audit. That's why **Web3Privacy Now** is ongoing research: aggregation (_we are here now_) - audit - scoring.

25.11. (current approach to PEDApps aggregation): _explicit focus on privacy + alive project_.

**Grant idea**: A research on how privacy web3-solutions are used within the Ukrainian-Russian war (with a focus on private currencies like Zcash).

**Specs**: 
- research based on the interviews with the different parties in need of external privacy protection (from NGOs receiving funds from abroad to volunteers on the Russian-controlled territories).
- it will highlight existing use-cases (like funding SUV for territorial defence forces) & potential (to be explored use-cases)
- it will be maximum practical, so use cases could be shared within Zcash community, partners & the media

**Format**:
- 100%-GitHub friendly
- PDF report
- UX/UI alike personas (PDF + PPTX)

**Category**: education & community

Moreover, I want to take a step further:
- Collaborate with Ukrainian DAO (https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO)
- present results publicly via Ukraine DAO events similar to https://twitter.com/KyivTechSummit
- expand the partner's network via (example Digital security lab: https://dslua.org)
- collab with Ukraine DAO to PR globally how Ukrainians are using privacy-enhancing solutions (also Zcash)

**Recommendation**: Jason McGee from Zcash Community Grants.

*Web3 tech stack could empower human privacy*

- **Raise awareness** about the necessity of privacy protection.
- **Build tools** to enhance privacy.
- **Advocate** for the following business models not based on surveillance capitalism. 

**Return human agency for data-driven decision making.**

_**Audiences**_

- **ecosystems** > Help builders come up with feasible ideas
- **hackathons** > Help teams deliver impactful solutions
- **individuals** > Scale up privacy-enhancing services experimentation
- **educators** > Advocate for privacy using a practical tool

The more use-cases would be shipped -> the better Web3-privacy would progress as a habit, lifestyle & basic human right.

## Humans 
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Humans%20title.png?raw=true) 

- Who are you building for?
- Why should they care?

**Create in-depth human-personas based on interviews or research.**
**
Web3 services usage**
- _What kind of web3 services this human uses?_
- _What are the data breaches in those services?_

**Privacy**
- How aware is a person of the necessity for privacy protection?
- How easily person would give up privacy in exchange for services or product features?
- Why this human needs privacy protection?
- What would happen with a human without additional privacy?

**Personal data literacy**
- Does a person know how his/her/theirs data has been abused?
- Does a person know how to protect himself/herself/themselves? 
- What kind of privacy-enhancing solutions does a person use?

**Empathy**
Try to talk with some of those people. Talk broadly about their internet rights, privacy, web3 services, and security. Make products for them & not just for yourself.

**Suggestions**
- Web2 users - help them to convert to Web3
- Web3 users - empower their existing services

**Hint**: focus on humans as communities, not just individuals.

## Data 
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Data%20title.png?raw=true) 

- What kind of data are you protecting?
- Why does this data matter?

**Write down a list of sensitive data you aim to protect or re-design business model.**


Data is the fuel of blockchain & surveillance capitalism. It’s regularly exploited & used by third parties without your consent. Not just Google or Facebook, but also Web3-services from wallets to CEXs collect personal data.

_Exploited data could be presented in different forms_:
- transactional data
- IP addresses
- name
- age
- geo 
- wallet address etc

**Example**
Google services track your online behaviour, make look-alike modelling & sell your profile to advertisers. So you become “a product”.

**References**
- Data brokers [Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_broker)
- Facebook-Cambridge Analytica [Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook–Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal)
- Data protection [basics](https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2019-07/190710%20Data%20Protection%20Basics.pdf)

**Suggestions**
- Explore how Data flows within the internet.
- Explore how Data brokers collect & sell sensitive data.
- Explore how Web2 & Web3 data correspond with each other.
- Analyse how much Data you share with third parties daily.

**Hint**: think of both on-chain & off-chain data when you are doing research.

## Challenge
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Challenge%20title.png?raw=true) 

-_ What are the main barriers on your way?_
- _How do they compromise the person, you, industry?_

**Write down a list of challenges that stand between humans & your idea.**

Web3 isn’t a transparent or regulated market. That’s why it’s easier to spy on humans. At the same time, humans don’t know how to choose the correct privacy-enhancing service.

**Examples**
- unregulated blockchain-data aggregation
- third party surveillance
- lack of privacy literacy
- “fake privacy” within existing solutions
- existing architecture allows third parties to spy on personal data

**Suggestion**
Analyse the Tornado Cash case from open-source development & DAO governance perspectives.

**Hint**: think of the ZK market that solves the challenge of preserving sensitive data while validating parts from KYC to age verification.

## Threat Actors
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Threat%20actors%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _Who is threatening privacy-balance?_
- _How do these bad actors use personal data?_

**Write down a list of multiple actors challenging web3 privacy from the data-analytics companies to marketing agencies. **

Specify what threats these actors cause: selling, spying, stealing data etc.


**Examples**

- **Corporations** - Google is at the heart of surveillance capitalism, selling humans’ data to advertisers.
- **Hackers** - exploit vulnerabilities in tech, sell databases with personal data.
- **Scammers** - malicious actors behind stolen funds.
- **Governments** - think of the [NSA](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying) or [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(spyware)) cases dealing with gov surveillance apparatus.
- **Data brokers** - specialises in collecting personal data or data about companies, mostly from public records but sometimes sourced privately, and selling or licensing such information (Experian, Equifax, Acxiom).

**References**
- Chainalysis used the block explorer website to collect wallets & other data: [click](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/21/leaked-slides-show-how-chainalysis-flags-crypto-suspects-for-cops/)
- ConsenSys revealed that it collects user data: [click](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/24/ethereum-software-firm-consensys-reveals-it-collects-user-data/)

**Hint**: actors could be both web2 or web3 native.

## Privacy layers
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Privacy%20layers%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _What privacy layer are you contributing to?_
- _What’s a trade-off compared to other layers?_

**Choose one of the different approaches to the web3 privacy-enhancing: from embedded to total anonymity. The approach depends on compliance-readiness & moral beliefs.  **

**Definitions**
- **Embedded** - network-level privacy that allows seamlessly deploy privacy within dApps. Privacy by default. Example: Manta Network
- **Configurable** - is a configurable approach to privacy that lets humans disclose their transactions to third parties. Example: Aztec
- **Enterprise ready** - enterprise grade & government compliant privacy protection standard. Example: NYM
- **Total anonymity** - human-centric privacy without compliance compromises & invisible to law enforcement units. Example: DarkFi

**Resource**: Web3 privacy layers overview from embedded to total anonymity [article](https://medium.com/p/4ddf8e7c3b4d)

**Hint**: think of a privacy implication complexity: KYC+AML could be great for accountability in the USA, but it means the death penalty in Iran

## Solution
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Solution%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _How your idea empower humans?_
- _How sustainable is your solution in 1-3-5 years?_

**Brainstorm the bravest ideas without the limits. Then, visualise them using traditional or digital surfaces.**

Apply the following filters to choose idea you like the most: 

Privacy-first: it’s in line with privacy-enhancement
**Usable**: it’s easy to use &/or implement

**Empowering**: it empowers humans’ lives

**Impactful**: it shapes existing surveillance vs privacy balance

**Feasible**: it’s possible to develop an idea from tech, open-source & economic points

**Examples (web3-native)**
- dVPN hides your actual IP address from third party websites & apps
- Messengers protect your private communication from exploitation
- Private currencies could protect human identity in front of oppressive government

**Hint**: lots of web3 solutions complement each other - an ecosystem-centric approach simplifies ideation/development  

## Partners
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Partners%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _What partners could scale your idea?_
- _What kind of value do these partners add?_

**Write down actors that could help you to activate or scale the solution.**

**Make reverse engineering**: imagine a time when your solution has been implemented on a broader scale. 
What kind of partners do you need to make this happen? 

**Examples**

**Investors** - cover development & marketing costs, scale up market delivery
**Developers** - implement & adapt the solution to speed up Product-market-Fit
**Institutions** - could advocate & adopt solutions (think of messenger like Signal here).
**Journalists** - they could become ambassadors of your solution
**Opinion Leaders** - both traditional or web3’s best actors preaching for change (from Vitalik to Shoshana Zuboff) 

**Hint**: partners should unlock value for you

## Resources
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Resources%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _What resources do you need for a start?_
- _What resources do you need to sustain your idea (1-3 years)?_

**Write down all potential resources you need to launch your idea & sustain it.**

**Split idea implementation into phases**: _MVP, Product-market-Fit, Scaling_.
Each phase requires a different amount of resources.

**Examples**
- Financial expenses
- Human resources
- Partners
- Legal support
- Investments
- Community
- Governance

**Study**
How Rotki is [trying](https://twitter.com/LefterisJP/status/1595827264956289024) to find the Product-Market-Fit being open-source + [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/149/rotki)

**Suggestions** 
- Think broadly about missing skills from the team (example: developer doing investment relations).
- Think about the potential business model (grants, sponsorships, subscriptions, fees etc)

**Hint**: resource management could come in handy, helping to understand feasibility of idea for yourself & wider audiences (from hackathon jury to investors) 

## Success metrics
![alt text](https://github.com/Msiusko/web3privacy/blob/main/Pagency/img/Success%20metrics%20title.png?raw=true) 

- _How would you measure success?_
-_ What is the one ultimate metric to track?_

Write down a list of metrics that define the success of the product.

**Think broadly about metrics**: what would they be for humans, partners or hackathon organisers?
**Play with the future vision**: how metrics would change from MVP to ultimate Product-Market-Fit?

**Examples**
**tech-centric**: GitHub-readiness: clean code, ease of fork, compostability;
**human-centric**: UX/UI-readiness, ease of use, Web2-to-Web3 conversion rate, the total amount of users, recurring users, word of mouth 
**community**: organic growth rate, the value-driven contribution rate


**Filter metrics via formula**
- the 1 ultimate metric (example: financial sustainability = revenue + organic growth)
- 3 key metrics (example: financial sustainability, DAO autonomy, market penetration)

**Hint**: always separate product performance metrics from the financial side

## Implementation

## **Principles of privacy-enhancing development**

**Human centered** 
> Place humans in the centre of your idea. Care about his/her/theirs emotions, crypto & privacy literacy.

**Solve an actual privacy-specific problem** 
> Empower humans with practical privacy solutions that could be used here & now.

**Accessible to the future Web3 audience** 
> Think about newcomers using your services in forthcoming years.

**Ethical** 
> Don’t build services for money laundering, criminal activities or violating human rights.

**Open-source** 
> Make your idea accessible to the world via GitHub, Devfolio, GitLab.

## **Idea valuation**

**Default state**: Decentralisation ethos sync  - it redistributes power from centralised actors back to humans.

**Problem Importance**
> How important is the problem being solved? (10: extremely important)

**Privacy-solution impact** (addressable market) 
> thousands, millions of humans

**Ease of implementation** 
> How complex is the implementation: budget, team, processes > from 1 to 10

**Effectiveness** 
> How effectively does the idea address the referenced problem? (10: ultimate effectiveness)

**Product-market-Fit** 
> time vs efficiency

**Community contribution** 
> re-usability, compostability

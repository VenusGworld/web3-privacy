*Web3 tech stack could empower human privacy*

**Raise awareness** about the necessity of privacy protection.

**Build tools** to enhance privacy.

**Advocate** for the following business models not based on surveillance capitalism. 

**Return human agency for data-driven decision making.**

_**Audiences**_

- **ecosystems** > Help builders come up with feasible ideas
- **hackathons** > Help teams deliver impactful solutions
- **individuals** > Scale up privacy-enhancing services experimentation
- **educators** > Advocate for privacy using a practical tool

The more use-cases would be shipped -> the better Web3-privacy would progress as a habit, lifestyle & basic human right.

_**Humans**_

_Who are you building for?
Why should they care?_

**Create in-depth human-personas based on interviews or research.**
**
Web3 services usage**
What kind of web3 services this human uses?
What are the data breaches in those services?

**Privacy**
- How aware is a person of the necessity for privacy protection?
- How easily person would give up privacy in exchange for services or product features?
- Why this human needs privacy protection?
- What would happen with a human without additional privacy?

**Personal data literacy**
Does a person know how his/her/theirs data has been abused?
Does a person know how to protect himself/herself/themselves? 
What kind of privacy-enhancing solutions does a person use?

**Empathy**
Try to talk with some of those people. Talk broadly about their internet rights, privacy, web3 services, and security. Make products for them & not just for yourself.

**Suggestions**
Web2 users - help them to convert to Web3
Web3 users - empower their existing services

**Hint**: focus on humans as communities, not just individuals.

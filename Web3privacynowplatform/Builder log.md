Had a call with experienced product manager. We discussed different approaches to scoring modelling, on-chain & off-chain data management, indexing protocols etc.

**Few observations**
- lots of privacy scoring directions are highly subjective (like "if team is ideological") & can't be automated in the DB
- Scoring model MVP would be oversimplified
- Because the ultimate goal -> on-chain reputation x privacy services (where [Unirep Protocol](https://about.unirep.social) & co are headed)
- But there should a point on a roadmap to receive also non-expert opinions from the people who would use privacy services. I think there will be interesting insights how they would approach asessment & "trust" (especially within non-web3 people).

To do
- apply "subjective/objective" lens to Expert recommendations
- apply "on-chain/off-chain" lens to recommendations
- analyze "objective" cohort
- analyze "on-chain" cohort

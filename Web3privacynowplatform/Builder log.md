**10 feb, spaceship earth**

Had a call with Nick Havrilyak (experienced product manager). We discussed different approaches to scoring modelling, on-chain & off-chain data management, indexing protocols etc.

**Few observations**
- lots of privacy scoring directions are highly subjective (like "if a team is ideological") & can't be automated in the DB
- The scoring model MVP would be oversimplified.
- Because the ultimate goal -> on-chain reputation x privacy services (where Unirep Protocol & co are headed)
- But there should be a point on a roadmap to receive non-expert opinions from the people who would use privacy services. I think there will be interesting insights into how they would approach assessment & "trust" (especially within non-web3 people).

**To do**
- apply a "subjective/objective" lens to Expert recommendations
- use "on-chain/off-chain" lens to recommendations
- analyze "objective" cohort
- analyze "on-chain" cohort
- create a simplified MVP vision (easy to deliver & scale further to more complex model)

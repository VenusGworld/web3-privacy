⚠️ **Note!** Highlighted Privacy Enhanced Decentralised Applications (PEDApps) facilitate a different approach to privacy. Their solutions' maturity varies from conceptualisation to mainnet. So use them cautiously, especially when projects don't have a third-party security audit. That's why **Web3Privacy Now** is ongoing research: aggregation (_we are here now_) - audit - scoring.

25.11. (current approach to PEDApps aggregation): _explicit focus on privacy + alive project_.
